_Official documentation of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)_

With the [Azure DevOps extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/devops?view=azure-cli-latest), we can reach most of the Azure DevOps services from the terminal, such as;

* [Create a Team Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/devops/project?view=azure-cli-latest#ext-azure-devops-az-devops-project-create)

Capabilities are almost endless with the [Azure DevOps extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/cli/?view=azure-devops) üéâ

But, you need to install the extension first.

Fortunately, installing an extension to [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) is trivial, you just need to add it to the extension list of [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) and configure it;
